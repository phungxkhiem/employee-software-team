The application can be used through a terminal as long as the user has node.js installed. The LTS version is recommended. A few more packages are required to run this application. If the user downloads this repository the packages are included. More information on the packages needed are in the Installation section of this README. This application is intended to help an employer generate an HTML file with their emplyees information. It generates one manager employee card and as many engineer and intern employee cards as the user desires. The 'usage' section will walk the user through the process.
